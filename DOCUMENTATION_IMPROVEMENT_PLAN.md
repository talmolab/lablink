## Documentation Standards

### Writing Guidelines
1. **Use active voice**: "Run the command" not "The command should be run"
2. **Include working examples**: Every code block should be copy-pasteable
3. **Add context**: Explain why, not just how
4. **Use consistent formatting**: Follow existing patterns
5. **Include troubleshooting**: Common errors with solutions
6. **Version compatibility**: Specify which versions apply
7. **Update dates**: Track when docs were last updated

### Template Structure
Every guide should have:
```markdown
# Title

## Overview
Brief description of what this covers and when to use it

## Prerequisites
What you need before starting

## Step-by-Step Instructions
Numbered steps with commands and explanations

## Verification
How to confirm it worked

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions

## Related Documentation
Links to other relevant docs
```

### Visual Standards
- Use Mermaid diagrams for technical diagrams
- Use screenshots for UI guidance
- Add alt text for accessibility
- Keep diagrams simple and focused
- Use consistent color schemes

## Automation Opportunities

### 1. Auto-Generated Documentation
- **API Reference**: Already done with MkDocs
- **Configuration Schema**: Generate from structured_config.py
- **Terraform Variables**: Extract from variables.tf
- **CLI Reference**: Generate from click/argparse

### 2. Documentation Testing
- **Link checker**: Verify all internal/external links work
- **Code example testing**: Run code blocks in CI
- **Screenshot updates**: Automate screenshot generation
- **Spell check**: Add to CI pipeline

### 3. Documentation Versioning
- Tag docs with software versions
- Show version selector in MkDocs
- Archive old version docs
- Show "updated for version X" badges

## Open Questions

1. **Video Content**: Worth the investment? Who will create?
2. **Versioning Strategy**: Version docs per release or just latest?
3. **Translation**: Support multiple languages?
4. **Platform**: Stay with MkDocs or migrate to something else?
5. **Access Control**: Public vs private sections?
6. **Feedback Mechanism**: How do users report doc issues?

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Prioritize which improvements to tackle first
3. Assign ownership for each documentation area
4. Set up project tracking (GitHub issues)
5. Create documentation improvement milestone

**First Sprint** (2 weeks):
1. Create quick-start guide
2. Write 2-3 operational runbooks
3. Create system architecture diagram
4. Set up link checker in CI
5. Reorganize docs folder

**Measure Progress**:
- Track documentation coverage
- Monitor user feedback
- Count support questions about docs
- Review time-to-first-deployment
- Survey user satisfaction
